# demo-starters

This is a demo project to demo the use of starters for your application.
It contains implementations to show the use of openapi, generic interceptors, oauth2 configuration.
The implementation of this starter is done in the [demo-use-starters] project.

NOTE: a library is also added here for simplicity, it will usually be a separate project but it's important to see 
the difference between a starter and a library and when to use which.
